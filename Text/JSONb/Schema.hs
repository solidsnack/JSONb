  JSON Schemas:

    document               ::=  array

    element                ::=  num | str | null | bool | object | array

    object                 ::=  "{" Set(element) "}"

    array                  ::=  "[" List(element) "]"

    num                    ::=  "num"
    str                    ::=  "str"
    null                   ::=  "null"
    bool                   ::=  "bool"

{-| The type of JSON schemas. We treat the atomic types simply whereas objects
    and arrays are treated specially.

    Objects are treated as maps of keys to sets of schema types. Say a certain
    type of object sometimes has a string at a certain key and sometimes has a
    null at that key; we should merge them and say the schema of that key is a
    union of string and null.

    Arrays admit measure in the sense of how many elements there are of a
    certain kind. We support three measures at present: any, one or more and
    individual counts. We expect the "any" measure to prevail practice. Arrays
    are also ordered; so one can distinguish an array that interleaves strings
    and ints from one that is all strings and then all ints.
